# Local_DDNS FOR Cloudflare DDNS user
Due to some unknown error occurred in my router at home, I figured out a way to write a local DDNS severice at my mac and kept it running every 12 hrs.

This is a local DDNS service written by myself.

It's very easy to use, run my code from 1 to 2.

STEP 1: Get your id info from CLOUDFLARE, and save it.

STEP 2: Fill the info you get from STEP 1, and replace on it.

STEP 3: Make the STEP 2 python program as the task scheduler(Windows) or Crontab in Mac.

Done
